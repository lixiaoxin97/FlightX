# FlightX

## Introduction
**FlightX** is a development platform for quadrotor.  
This idea was originally from **[flightmare](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare)** and **[rpg_quadrotor_control](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_quadrotor_control)**. I made several changes.

## Environment requirements
ubuntu 20.04  
ROS Humble Hawksbill
